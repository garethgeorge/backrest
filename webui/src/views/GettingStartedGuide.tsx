          Plans are where you configure directories to backup, and backup

          Backup your ResticUI configuration: your ResticUI config holds all of
          your repos, plans, and the passwords to decrypt them. When you have
          ResticUI configured to your liking make sure to store a copy of your
          config (or minimally a copy of your passwords) in a safe location e.g.
          a secure note in your password manager.
