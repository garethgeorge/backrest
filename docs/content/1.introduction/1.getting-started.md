# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the basic steps to setup a new [Backrest](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest) instance.

## Installation

See the <a href="https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest" target="_blank">Github README</a> for installation instructions for your platform.

## Terminology

- **Restic Repo** Backrest uses [restic](https://restic.net) under-the-hood to manage backups. A restic repo is a location where restic will store your backup data, this detail is typically abstracted away from the user by Backrest but is important to understand as it means you have the option to use the restic CLI to interact with snapshots created by Backrest directly if you wish.
- **Repo** A Backrest repo (called a Repo from here on) is configuration data which identifies a location where your backup data will be stored (forwarded to restic), the credentials that will encrypt your backup data, hooks, and any options needed by backrest to orchestrate your backups.
- **Plan** A Backrest plan (called a Plan from here on) is configuration data that describes a schedule for taking snapshots, forgetting old snapshots, and running prune operations. Multiple plans can write data to the same Backrest repo.
- **Operations**
  - A **Backup** creates a restic snapshot and send it to a repo.
  - A **Forget** operation marks old snapshots for deletion but does not remove data from storage.
  - A **Prune** operation removes data from storage that is no longer referenced by any snapshot (see [restic docs on forget and prune](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/060_forget.html)).
  - A **Restore** operation retrieves files from a snapshot and writes them to a location on disk.

## Configuration

::alert{type="info"}
Once backrest is installed, you can access the web interface at `http://localhost:9898` (or the port you configured). Backrest will immediately prompt you for required initial configuration of an instance ID and a default user and password.
::

Instance ID

 * The instance ID is a unique identifier for your Backrest instance. This is used to tag snapshots created by Backrest so that you can distinguish them from snapshots created by other instances. This is useful if you have multiple Backrest instances backing up to the same repo.
 * *Notably the instance ID cannot be changed after initial configuration as it is stored in your snapshots. Choose a value carefully.*

Username and password

 * Username and password is set on first launch of Backrest. If you lose your password you can reset it by deleting the `"users"` key from the `~/.config/backrest/config.json` file (or `%appdata%\backrest\config.json` on Windows) and restarting the Backrest service.
 * If you don't want to use authentication (e.g. a local only installation or if you're using an authenticating reverse proxy) you can disabled authentication.


#### Add a new repository

A Backrest repository is implemented as a restic repository under-the-hood (more on this later). A Repo is a configuration object which identifies a storage location and the credentials that will be used to encrypt snapshots sent to that storage. You can either add an existing repo that you created on the restic CLI or create a new one in the Backrest UI. In either case, click the "Add Repo" button in the UI to configure Backrest to use your backup location.

The primary properties of a repository are:

- **Repo Name** A human-readable name for the repository. This is used to identify the repository in the UI and is immutable after creation.

- **Repo URI** identifies the location where the repo's data is stored. This corresponds to the URI used by restic. See [the restic docs](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html) for the repo types that restic supports. For common storage providers this looks like:

  - Backblaze: `b2:yourbucket` or `b2:yourbucket/pathprefix`
  - AWS S3 (or S3 compatible storage): `s3:yourbucket` or `s3:yourbucket/pathprefix`
  - SFTP e.g. `sftp:user@host:/path/to/repo` (note `sftp://` is known to have issues in some cases, do not include a double slash prefix).
  - Local path: `/mnt/backupdisk/repo1`.
  - Rclone remote: `rclone:remote:path`. See the [rclone docs](https://rclone.org/docs/) for more information. To use rclone remotes, you must first install and configure rclone and ensure that the rclone config (e.g. `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`) is available to the backrest process.

- **Environment Variables** environment variables provide additional configuration to restic (typically related to credentials for the storage provider). Common examples are

  - For S3 storage set: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - For B2 storage set: `B2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `B2_ACCOUNT_KEY`

- **Flags** additional flags to provide to restic. At the moment only presence flags are supported. Common usage might include:

  - `-o sftp.args="-i /path/to/key"` will pass an SSH key to restic for use with SFTP repositories.
  - `--no-lock` will disable the use of locks in the restic repository. This can be useful for read-only repos.
  - `--limit-upload 1000` will limit the upload speed to a speed in kilobytes per second (e.g. 1000KB/s). This can be useful to avoid saturating a network connection.
  - `--limit-download 1000` will limit the download speed to a speed in kilobytes per second (e.g. 1000KB/s). This can be useful to avoid saturating a network connection.

- **Hooks** are actions triggered by backup lifecycle events, repo hooks will apply to actions run by any plan that writes to the repo. Hooks can also be configured at the plan level. See the [hooks documentation](/docs/hooks) for more information.

- **Prune Policy** the policy that determines when prune operations will run. Prune operations clean up unreferenced data in your repo (freeing up storage in your repo over time). See the [prune documentation](/docs/operations#prune) for more information.
- **Check Policy** the policy that determines when check operations will run. Check operations periodically verify the integrity of your backups. See the [check documentation](/docs/operations#check) for more information.

::alert{type="info"}
Once you've added your repo you're ready to import snapshots (click Index Snapshots) if you have existing data. Go on to configure a backup plan to start creating new snapshots.

#### Configure a backup plan

A Backrest plan is a configuration object which describes a schedule for taking snapshots, retention of old snapshots, and running prune operations. Multiple plans can write data to the same Backrest repo. To create a new plan, click the "Add Plan" button in the UI and populate the plan configuration:

The primary properties of a plan are:

- **Plan Name** the plan name is immutable after creation, choose carefully. Organizationally it can help to choose a name that includes the type of storage or a short form of the name of the repo that will be used. E.g. to backup "Documents" directory to "b2storage" you might create a plan named "b2-documents" or similar.

- **Repository** the repository that this plan will operate on. This is immutable after creation.

- **Paths** a list of paths to include in backups.

- **Excludes** a list of paths to exclude from backup operations. These can be fully qualified paths (e.g. /foo/bar/baz) or wildcard paths (e.g. `*node_modules*`). See the [restic docs](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/040_backup.html#excluding-files) on excluding files for more details. Files listed in excludes map to restic's `--excludes` flag.

- **Schedule** the schedule on which backups will run. 
  
  - This can be specified as an interval in hours, interval in days, or as a cron providing detailed control over when backups run (e.g. `0 0 * * *` for midnight every day). 
  - A clock can also be configured which determines the time the schedule is checked against. UTC or Local use the current wall-clock time but will evaluate differently when using cron expressions where the timezone matters. Last Run Time evaluates the schedule relative to the last time the task ran rather than the current wall time, this can be useful for ensuring tasks aren't skipped if the schedule is missed for some reason (e.g. on a laptop that is frequently asleep).

- **Retention Policy** the duration that snapshots are retained for. This is enforced by running `restic forget` after each backup operation if a retention policy is specified. This can be set to none for append only repos or if you'd like to manage your own retention (e.g. run forget manually). Setting some retention policy is recommended to avoid the snapshot history growing without bound. Retention may be configured either based on count or bucketed by time period. See [the restic docs](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/060_forget.html#removing-snapshots-according-to-a-policy) to understand more about these policy options. Supported modes are:

  - **By Count** - keeps a fixed number of snapshots. E.g. keep the last 7 snapshots.
  - **By Time Period** - keeps snapshots in a time-based bucket. E.g. keep 1 snapshot per day for the last 7 days, 1 snapshot per week for the last 4 weeks, and 1 snapshot per month for the last 12 months.
  - **None** - no retention policy is enforced. This is useful for append-only repos or if you'd like to manage retention manually e.g. in an external script. Note that care should be taken not to allow snapshots to grow without bound (though Backrest will typically scale and perform well with hundreds to thousands of snapshots).

- **Hooks** hooks are actions that can be configured in response to backup lifecycle events. See the [hooks documentation](/docs/hooks) for more information and the [hooks cookbook](/cookbooks/command-hook-examples) for examples.
- **Backup Flags** flags that are specific to the backup command (e.g. `--force` to force a full scan of all files rather than relying on metadata). These flags are passed directly to the restic command.
  - `--one-file-system` will prevent restic crossing filesystem boundaries.
  - `--force` will force rereading all files on each backup rather than relying on metadata (e.g. last modified time). This can be much slower.
  - `--skip-if-unchanged` will skip creating a new snapshot if nothing has changed on the filesystem. Note that the backup task will still appear in the 'Full Operation History' but not in the tree view. Snapshots will still be created if any file or folder metadata changes (e.g. permissions, access times, etc).

::alert{type="success"}
Success! Now that Backrest is configured you can sit back and let it manage your backups. You can monitor the status of your backups in the UI and restore files from snapshots as needed.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
Make sure that you save a copy of your repo credentials and any encryption keys (e.g. the password) in a safe place. If you lose these you will not be able to restore your data. It can be a good idea to store your entire Backrest config (typically located at `~/.config/backrest/config.json`) in a secure location e.g. a password manager or encrypted storage.
