# Command Hook Examples

## Introduction

Command hooks are a powerful way to extend Backrest's capabilities. They allow you to run arbitrary shell commands in response to lifecycle events. This doc shows examples of command hooks.

## Command Hook Options

When run on `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_START` command hooks have the ability to send control signals to Backrest based on the exit status of the script. The handling of the exit status is configured by the `Error Behavior` field. The following options are available:

- `ON_ERROR_CANCEL` - If the script exits with a non-zero status, the backup operation will be canceled.
- `ON_ERROR_FATAL` - If the script exits with a non-zero status, it is treated as a backup failure and error notifications are triggered.
- `ON_ERROR_IGNORE` - If the script exits with a non-zero status, the backup operation will continue and the error will be ignored.

## Examples


#### Notify a healthcheck service

Ping a healthcheck service (e.g. https://healthchecks.io/ in the example) to notify it of backup status (or failure) using a command hook.

Note that this hook example takes advantage of the fact that the hook is a golang template to render different commands based on whether an error occurred.

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_END`

**Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
{{ if .Error -}}
curl -fsS --retry 3 https://hc-ping.com/your-uuid/fail
{{ else -}}
curl -fsS --retry 3 https://hc-ping.com/your-uuid
{{ end -}}
```

**Error Behavior:** `ON_ERROR_IGNORE`

#### (MacOS) Show system notification

Show a system notification using the `osascript` command on MacOS.

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_END`, `CONDITION_PRUNE_ERROR`, `CONDITION_CHECK_ERROR`

**Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
{{ if .Error -}}
osascript -e 'display notification "{{ .ShellEscape .Task }} failed" with title "Backrest"'
{{ else -}}
osascript -e 'display notification "{{ .ShellEscape .Task }} succeeded" with title "Backrest"'
{{ end -}}
```


#### Check for internet connectivity

Add a hook to check for internet connectivity before running a backup.

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_START`

**Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if ping -q -c 1 -W 1 google.com >/dev/null; then
  echo "Internet connection is up"
  exit 0
else
  echo "Internet connection is down"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Error Behavior:** `ON_ERROR_CANCEL`

#### Check that a target directory exists

Add a hook to check that a target directory exists before running a backup.

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_START`

**Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -d /path/to/backup ]; then
  echo "Backup directory exists"
  exit 0
else
  echo "Backup directory does not exist"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Error Behavior:** `ON_ERROR_CANCEL`


#### Create a BTRFS filesystem snapshot before running a backup

Add a hook that creates a btrfs snapshot prior to each backup (overwriting any prior snapshot). This is useful for creating a point in time consistent copy of the filesystem for restic to read from. It eliminates the possibility of inconsistency due to the time it takes restic to scan your files during a backup.

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_START`

**Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /your-btrfs-filesystem /your-btrfs-filesystem/.backrest-snapshot
```

**Error Behavior:** `ON_ERROR_FATAL` (if the snapshot fails, the backup should fail)

Note: you may also add a hook to delete the snapshot after the backup is complete e.g. 

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_END`

**Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
btrfs subvolume delete /your-btrfs-filesystem/.backrest-snapshot
```

**Error Behavior:** `ON_ERROR_IGNORE` (even if the snapshot deletion fails, the backup was already successful)

#### Check that the battery is above a certain level

Add a hook to check that the battery is above a certain level before running a backup.

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_START`

**Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ $(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity) -gt 80 ]; then
  echo "Battery level is above 20%"
  exit 0
else
  echo "Battery level is below 20%"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Error Behavior:** `ON_ERROR_CANCEL`

### Windows PowerShell examples
#### GUI message box on error condition
The message box stays on screen until acknowledged by the user. Use the same script for both backup plan and repo settings to catch errors.

**Condition** `CONDITION_ANY_ERROR`

**Script**
```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
# This option puts message box on top of all windows.
$options = [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxOptions]::ServiceNotification
$defbutton = [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxDefaultButton]::Button1
$buttons = [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxButtons]::OK
$icon = [System.Windows.Forms.MessageBoxIcon]::Error
$title = "Backrest"
$message = '{{ .Summary }}'
[System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::Show($message, $title, $buttons, $icon, $defbutton, $options)

# Include this comment and the line above it. See https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest/issues/400
```
#### GUI toast warning notification
Toast or app notifications appear for a short time before disappearing without user acknowledgement.

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_WARNING`

**Script**
```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
$balloon = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon
$balloon.Icon = [System.Drawing.SystemIcons]::Warning
$balloon.BalloonTipIcon = [System.Windows.Forms.ToolTipIcon]::Warning
$balloon.BalloonTipText = '{{ .Summary }}'
$balloon.BalloonTipTitle = "Backrest"
$balloon.Visible = $true
$balloon.ShowBalloonTip(5000)
Start-Sleep -Seconds(5)
$balloon.Visible = $false
$balloon.Icon.Dispose()
$balloon.Dispose()

# Include this comment and the line above it. See https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest/issues/400
```
#### GUI toast information notification

**Condition** `CONDITION_SNAPSHOT_SUCCESS`

**Script**
```powershell
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
$balloon = New-Object System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon
$balloon.Icon = [System.Drawing.SystemIcons]::Information
$balloon.BalloonTipIcon = [System.Windows.Forms.ToolTipIcon]::Information
$balloon.BalloonTipText = '{{ .Summary }}'
$balloon.BalloonTipTitle = "Backrest"
$balloon.Visible = $true
$balloon.ShowBalloonTip(5000)
Start-Sleep -Seconds(5)
$balloon.Visible = $false
$balloon.Icon.Dispose()
$balloon.Dispose()

# Include this comment and the line above it. See https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest/issues/400
```
